PushButton Master Server Build Instructions
===============================================================================

1) Be sure to have CMake v2.6 or later installed on your build host
  RPM using Linux distributions:
	yum whatprovides cmake
	yum install <packageName>

  APT using Linux distributions:
	apt-cache search cmake
	apt-get install <packageName>

  Others get cmake from:
	http://www.cmake.org/


2) While in the pbms/ directory run the following to create the Makefile(s)
  cmake .


3) Now run make:
  make


4) You should now have a binary in pbms/masterd/masterd so run it:
  ./masterd/masterd

  On first run it will create a masterd.prf preferences/confituration file
  in the current directory, edit it to your liking, and restart the daemon.


Pro Tip: pbms currently does not deattach its self and go into background
	 process on its own. There are several ways to deal with this:

	 A) Use `screen`, run the masterd binary, and press Ctrl+A then D to
	    de-attach fron the screen process and get dropped back to the
	    terminal again. Of which you can resume anytime using `screen -r`.

	 B) Use `nohup`:
	    nohup masterd/masterd &

	 C) Try daemonize from http://software.clapper.org/daemonize/


The End
